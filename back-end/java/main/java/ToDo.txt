1.) For the list of possible dorm buildings and campus locations, add Buxton, 
    Chen, DanOff, Sternlight, and Wayland.

2.) For the underlying data structure for floorNumbers, use a specific enum instead
    of an int.

3.) In the RoomParser, update getRooms to work on a lsit instead of an interator to
    increase code readability.

4.) Enable the backend API to take different parameter types for roomCapacity. For example,
    allow roomCapacity=1 or roomCapacity=one.

5.) Change the floorPlanLink for dorm rooms to be in the BearDens link. This enforces
    that students are logged into Brown before opening the floorPlanLink.
